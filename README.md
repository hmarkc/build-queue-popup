## Build Queue Popup Plugin 
This plugin overwrites the orginal Build Queue:

By clicking the area around the '\*' sign, a pop-up will show:

This build information is identical to that displayed in the tooltip when your cursor hovers over the build name. 

## Motivation 
Sometimes the build information tooltip fails to show up correctly because of the window size. This plugin is a simple solution to that.
